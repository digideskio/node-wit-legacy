# node-wit-legacy
node-wit-legacy is a port of https://github.com/wit-ai/node-wit/ package for older nodejs versions. Current version of node-wit uses node 6+ and therefore cannot be used for example in AWS Lambda.

This package will be deprecated if pull request https://github.com/wit-ai/node-wit/pull/95 is merged or support for older node versions is provided some other way.
